Hi,

I'm `Jayice`.  

`Jayice` means nothing, when i was a kid, i was struggling with how to name my game role, so i typed at random on my keyboard, then `Jayice` appeared.

I’m passionate about coding and specialize in database and distributed system. (Maybe temporarily, :D

Also I am a landscape photography enthusiast，dream to travel around the world and take wonderful photos.

Focus on (technical)
- Database
- Distributed System

Focus on (non-technical)
- Photography
- Movies
- Hanna
