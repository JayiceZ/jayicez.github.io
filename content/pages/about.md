Hi.

I'm `Jingwei Zhou`, and also `Jayice`, `JayiceZ` etc... 

`Jayice` means nothing, when i was a kid, i was struggling with how to name my game role, so i typed at random on my keyboard, then `Jayice` appeared.

Some tags on me:
- `rookie developer`
- `rookie photographer`
- `senior loser`

Focus on (technical)
- Storage
- Distributed System
- Operating System

Focus on (non-technical)
- Photography
- Cat
- Movies
- Hanna
